Sorry for delay, everyone!

Windows binary (x86, including the configuration file) has been uploaded. You may need to download Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86) in order to run this.

It can be downloaded here:

This project is a flexible plugin for the open-source Open Babel chemical software suite that allows for the conversion between 80 chemical file formats to an RDF (Resource Description Framework) / OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontology.

We will be updating wiki in the next couple of days to illustrate usage examples.
Also we are working on providing windows and linux binaries at the moment.

Thank you.
